# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## As a pipeline phase

As a default pipeline phase, prototype's input is the PRD/idea plus any research; its output is the settled look, with any design-system conventions appended to root `DESIGN.md`. It is the gated-design halt point — get user sign-off on the look before `design`/`implement`. Skip it only when the work has no UI surface, recording the skip on the marker's `pipeline:` row.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered — from the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [logic.md](logic.md). Build a tiny interactive terminal app that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [ui.md](ui.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts — getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Locate the prototype code close to where it will actually be used (next to the module or page it's prototyping for) so context is obvious — but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production. For throwaway UI routes, obey whatever routing convention the project already uses; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **One command to run.** Whatever the project's existing task runner supports — `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. The user must be able to start it without thinking.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE — wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast and then delete it.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Delete or absorb when done.** When the prototype has answered its question, either delete it or fold the validated decision into the real code — don't leave it rotting in the repo.
7. **HTML views.** Mockups stay scratch in `.workflow/<id>/` — `docs/` never holds per-work-item files. A choice worth keeping survives as a convention appended to `DESIGN.md`, or a screenshot + markup pasted into the ADR recording it — never as a kept mockup.
8. **Design-system tokens.** Colors, typography, and components belong in the root **DESIGN.md** (the design-system spec). Prototype/UI work maintains that file; throwaway exploratory mockups stay scratch and don't touch it. An append to `DESIGN.md` counts as a docs-sync — record it on the marker's `docs:` row.

## When done

The _answer_ is the only thing worth keeping from a prototype. Capture it somewhere durable (commit message, ADR, issue, or a `NOTES.md` next to the prototype) along with the question it was answering. If the user is around, that capture is a quick conversation; if not, leave the placeholder so they (or you, on the next pass) can fill in the verdict before deleting the prototype.
