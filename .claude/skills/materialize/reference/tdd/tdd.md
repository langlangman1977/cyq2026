# TDD

Test-driven development: red, green, refactor, one behavior at a time.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

Use the domain glossary so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language; respect ADR status (accepted binds, proposed is planning context only) — see [`../init/domain.md`](../init/domain.md).

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm the interface changes needed against the plan artifact (tech-design / prepared issue)
- [ ] Confirm which behaviors to test (prioritize) against the same artifact
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](interface-design.md)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Check the plan back with the conductor before writing any test

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?" — answer from the plan artifact and the codebase; ask the user only when one of the three gates fires.

**Tests live at seams** — the public boundaries where you observe behavior, never against internals. You can't test everything: write down the seams under test and confirm them against the plan artifact before writing any test — these are the pre-agreed seams `implement` hands you. Agreeing them up front is how effort lands on critical paths and complex logic, not every edge case.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:      Write next test → fails
GREEN:    Minimal code to pass → passes
REFACTOR: Clean what this cycle touched → tests still pass
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

**Refactor at every green, not at the end.** You just wrote the code, so you still know which parts were expedient — a later pass reads the same mess with none of that context, and every cycle after this one builds on whatever you left. Bound it to the reach of the test you just passed and to mechanical moves (extract a function, rename, collapse a duplicate); anything wider waits for step 4, or the loop turns into a redesign against a feature that isn't finished yet.

### 4. Refactor The Whole

The per-cycle cleanups leave only what a single cycle couldn't justify — shape that's visible once every behavior is in. After all tests pass, look for the wider [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
[ ] What this cycle touched is cleaned, tests still green
```
