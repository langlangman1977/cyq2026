# Verify

Independent confirmation that a change **meets its spec**. The verifier is a **fresh sub-agent that
did NOT write the code** — never the implementer self-checking. Distinct from `review`: review
critiques code quality; verify confirms behavior matches what was asked.

The default for materialize's **verify** slot. If the repo binds another verify skill, use that;
else run this.

## At PRD scope (accept)

Invoked as **`accept`** (the final SPEC phase): same procedure, at whole-PRD scope — every behavior
across all issues, driven live through the **browser** slot (no browser skill bound → exercise the
flows by hand) against the running app, not a single diff. Never mark a UI predicate PASS without
observing it live. Unresolved FAILs become new Issues, per the pipeline gate. The verdict sets
`accepted:` in the marker.

## 1. Pin the predicates

**EARS** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) writes each requirement as "When \<trigger\>, the
\<system\> shall \<response\>" — giving every verdict a checkable predicate.

Collect what the change is supposed to do, in order:

1. **EARS predicates** from the research doc (`.workflow/<id>/NN-research-*.md`) or PRD —
   `WHEN <trigger> THE SYSTEM SHALL <behavior>`.
2. **Acceptance criteria** from the Issue / spec.
3. If none are written, derive a short **context-grounded rubric** from the Issue and the changed
   code — one checkable line per intended behavior.

Pin any **preserved invariants** the Issue lists (green-at-base regression guards) too, but verify them as *must-still-hold*: a PASS means the guard still holds, not that this change delivered it — keep them out of the delivered-work tally, or the roll-up reads as coverage the change didn't earn.

Write each predicate as an **observable check** — a command (or interaction) plus its expected result — never vague prose like "works correctly." A predicate you can't turn into a check is itself a finding.

**Establish a baseline first.** Capture and run the project's verification commands (build, test, lint, typecheck). Nothing runnable is the first **FAIL** — there's nothing to verify against. If it's red, separate a regression from inherited debt: reproduce on the unchanged tree (stash, or check out the base). Red the change **introduced** (green→red, or a new failure) is its FAIL; red already failing on the base and unrelated to the change isn't — note it, verify against the rest, and don't block the verdict on debt the change merely inherited.

**The headline command is not the whole suite.** Contract, integration, golden-sample, and per-package groups often sit behind their own commands that CI calls separately and the default runner never touches — so a change can go green while the consumer it broke is checked by nothing you ran. Name the modules this diff changes, follow the repo's own dependency evidence (workspace dependencies, the import graph, build and CI config) out to their consumers, and add whichever verification commands cover them. Take the evidence as far as it goes and no further: dynamic imports, runtime registration, generated code, and consumers outside this repo don't show up in it. A downstream area you couldn't reach is **UNVERIFIED** with the reason — never a silent omission, and never a PASS inherited from the changed module's own green.

## 2. Consistency pass

Before the per-predicate checks, cross-check the spec artifacts against each other and the diff —
PRD ↔ Issues / acceptance criteria ↔ tech design (`.workflow/<id>/tech-design.md`) / ADRs ↔ the actual change. Flag any:

- **requirement with no implementing change** — stated behavior that nothing in the diff delivers;
- **change with no requirement** — code that no predicate or criterion asked for;
- **contradiction** — artifacts that disagree (an ADR vs. the PRD, an acceptance criterion vs. the
  diff).

Report each mismatch alongside the predicate verdicts; an empty list is itself a result.

## 3. Spawn a fresh verifier

One sub-agent that has **not** seen the implementation reasoning. Its contract:

- **role** — an independent fresh-context check of one predicate-set; never the implementer
  self-checking. Hand it the predicates / rubric and the diff or changed files.
- **depth** — nest its own sub-agents up to the working depth when one predicate-set splits into independent
  checks.
- **built-ins first** — bound **code-search** slot if the repo records one, else built-in
  **Explore**/`general-purpose`.
- **file contract** — verifier **WRITES** verdicts and evidence to a file (`.workflow/<id>/` scratch,
  `docs/` durable); orchestrator **READS** it — never a prompt relay.

The brief —

> For each predicate, determine PASS or FAIL by *observing actual behavior*: run the command, read
> the file, exercise the path — for UI/product behavior, **drive the running app** via the `browser`
> slot. Quote concrete evidence for every verdict. Do not assume; if you
> can't observe it, mark **UNVERIFIED** and say why. No code-quality critique — that's `review`.

## 4. Report per predicate

One row per predicate — verdict plus the evidence that earned it:

| Predicate | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| WHEN … SHALL … | PASS / FAIL / UNVERIFIED | command run · file:line · observed behavior |

Evidence must be concrete: the command and its output, the `file:line` checked, or the behavior seen
when the path was exercised. A PASS with no evidence is a FAIL.

End with a one-line roll-up: counts per verdict, and the single most important FAIL (if any).

## 5. Route the FAILs

Fix trivial FAILs in-session. For the rest — and every UNVERIFIED — **propose** a tracker issue per
finding (title, the predicate, the observed evidence), and file them via the `issues` mode / `tracker`
slot **only after the user confirms**. Each issue links back to its predicate. Don't block the
roll-up on filing; an unconfirmed list is a valid end state — **except** per-issue verify, where open
FAILs block that issue's PR (see *At PRD scope (accept)* above for the `accept` variant).

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Independence | Verifier never wrote the code; fresh context |
| Evidence | Every verdict cites a command / file / observed behavior |
| Scope | Confirm behavior vs spec — not code quality (use `review`) |
| Reach | Green on the changed module is not green on its consumers — run their checks, or mark them UNVERIFIED |
| Honesty | Can't observe it → **UNVERIFIED**, never an assumed PASS |
| No reassurance | An unsettleable correctness claim stays **UNVERIFIED** until a named test or empirical observation settles it — never accept "should be fine" as a PASS |
