# Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary:

- Run the [`design`](../design/design.md) mode for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use these terms exactly in every suggestion — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."
- The domain language in `CONTEXT.md` gives names to good seams; accepted ADRs in `docs/adr/` record decisions this command should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Read the domain glossary and ADR status first — accepted ADRs bind, proposed ADRs are planning context only; see [`../init/domain.md`](../init/domain.md).

**Scope before you scan.** If the user named a direction — a module, a subsystem, a pain point — take it; otherwise read the recent commit history (`git log --oneline`) and let the paths that keep coming up pull first, widening the net again if change is spread evenly with no hot spot. A deepening pays off only through the edits that follow it, so one in code nobody touches is leverage you never cash in.

Then use the Agent tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- What hard or likely-to-change decision does each module exist to hide — its **secret** (Parnas)? A module that hides no such decision is shallow. When the secret leaks — callers must know it to use the module — it's part of the interface after all, so the module is shallower than it looks.
- Where is a module deep at its interface but hard to *enter* — the implementation forces you through low-level mechanics before the domain flow, invariants, or error modes are clear?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Where is the same decision — a validation rule, a format, a policy constant — duplicated across modules, so updating one copy leaves the others to drift silently? A single owning module for it is a deepening: extraction concentrates the decision rather than just moving it.
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

**A sound area is a successful explore.** You were asked to find friction, not evidence that friction exists — if nothing clears the deletion test, that's the finding. Don't manufacture a candidate to have something to present in step 2; a false deepening costs more than a missed one, since the user spends grilling effort on a refactor that only moves complexity around.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

No candidates cleared the deletion test? Skip the report — tell the user the area is sound, cite what you checked, and stop.

Write a self-contained HTML file to `.workflow/<id>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` (gitignored scratch, so resume and handoff find it). With no work item, use the OS temp directory instead: resolve it from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%` on Windows). Open it for the user — `xdg-open <path>` on Linux, `open <path>` on macOS, `start <path>` on Windows — and tell them the absolute path.

The report carries its **styling inline** so it renders with no network, and pulls **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality, leverage, and progressive disclosure (how much easier the module is to enter for maintainers and agents), and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge
- **Evidence** — the `file:line` that shows the friction, so the claim is checkable
- **Effort / Risk / Confidence** — effort to deepen (`S`/`M`/`L`); risk the refactor introduces regressions; confidence `HIGH` (read the code), `MED` (needs verification), `LOW` (a smell)

Order candidates by **leverage** = expected impact ÷ effort, discounted by confidence, the risk of the fix, and how rarely the module changes. Float **verification-unblockers** (a missing baseline, characterization tests over an untested seam you'd touch) to the top — they make every later refactor safer.

**"Not worth it" is a valid verdict.** When the deletion test or the leverage math says a suspected candidate isn't worth deepening, record it as one line with the reason so the next audit doesn't re-surface it. If the reason is load-bearing and durable, offer an ADR (step 3).

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and the `design` vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an accepted ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids. The inverse is always a finding: when the **code has drifted from** what an accepted ADR records, the drift itself is the candidate — the doc or the code is wrong and the team should know; don't read the ADR as proof the code is fine.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, run the `grilling` loop to walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize — apply the [domain-modeling discipline](../design/domain-modeling.md) to keep the domain model current as you go:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`?** Add the term to `CONTEXT.md`. Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones. See [ADR-FORMAT.md](../design/ADR-FORMAT.md).
- **User accepts the candidate?** The loop ends at design + docs — this mode never writes the implementation. Offer to hand off to [`issues`](../issues/issues.md) to track the refactor as work, or [`tdd`](../tdd/tdd.md) to drive it test-first. Tracking and implementation live in those modes, not here.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Run the `design` mode and use its design-it-twice parallel sub-agent pattern.
