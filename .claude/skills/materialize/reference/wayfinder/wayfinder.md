# Wayfinder

This mode — **wayfinder** — applies when a loose idea requires more than one agent session to turn into a plan. It builds a **decision map** in the repo's issue tracker and drives the user through a sequence of issues that resolve the open questions — by research, prototyping, discussion, or manual task.

The tracker is the bound `tracker` capability slot; its operations (create an issue, link a blocking edge, claim, close) live in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` — run [`init`](../init/init.md) if it's missing.

## The decision map

The map lives in the tracker, not a single file, so it scales past one context window:

- **One map issue** is the index. Its body holds two separate buckets — **fog** and **deferred** (see below) — plus, per issue, a one-line gist plus a link to the issue, along with the blocking edges between them. It **gists and links; it never restates** an issue's answer.
- **Each issue is created as a child issue** of the map. The issue body holds the question and, once resolved, the answer — the answer lives here and only here.

A session loads the **map issue at low resolution** — the index — then zooms into a single issue to resolve it. You never need the whole map in context at once; that is what lets it grow.

### Issue structure

Each issue is created as a child of the map:

```markdown
Title: <outcome-framed question>

Blocked by: <issue links, via the tracker's native dependency mechanism>
Type: Research | Prototype | Grilling | Task

## Question

<question-here>

## Answer

<recorded when the issue is resolved, then the issue is closed>
```

These issues capture open questions to resolve, not implementation work — implementation slices are created later by the separate [`issues`](../issues/issues.md) mode.

Size each issue to one 100K-token agent session.

## Issue Types

There are four types of issues:

- **Research**: Reading documentation, third-party API's, or local resources like knowledge bases. Prefer primary sources — official docs, specs, first-party APIs — over secondary write-ups, and follow each claim to its owning source. Creates a markdown summary as an asset. Use this when knowledge outside the current working directory is required.
- **Prototype**: Writing UI or logic code to test a hypothesis, or to explore a design space. Uses the [`prototype`](../prototype/prototype.md) mode. Creates a prototype as an asset. Use this when "how should it look" or "how should it behave" is the key question.
- **Grilling**: Conversation with the user, not the agent — [`grill`](../grill/grill.md) waits for their answer to each question. Uses [domain modeling](../design/domain-modeling.md). The default case. Unlike the other three types, it cannot resolve unattended.
- **Task**: Literal manual work that must happen before the map can move — nothing to decide, prototype, or research: moving data, signing up for a service, provisioning access. Automate it where you can; otherwise hand the user a precise checklist. Resolved when done — the answer records what was done and any facts (credentials location, new URLs, counts) later issues depend on.

## Fog of war

The map is _deliberately_ incomplete beyond the frontier. The fog lives in the map issue's body. Your job is to investigate the frontier and resolve issues to push it forward — graduating a patch of fog into one or more child issues, one node at a time. When fog graduates into an issue, clear that patch from the map issue so a question never lives in two places.

At some point, the fog of war should have been pushed back far enough that the path to the finish line is clear. At that point, no more issues will be required and the decision map can be considered 'done'.

**Fog or issue?** Whether you can _state_ the question sharply now — not whether you can answer it. A blocked issue you can't act on yet is still an issue; fog is what you can't yet phrase that sharply. Don't pre-slice fog into issue-sized pieces — one patch may graduate into several issues, or none.

## Deferred work

Not everything you notice belongs in the map. Something real but out of scope — a nice-to-have, a later phase, a tangent surfaced mid-grill — goes in a **deferred** bucket in the map issue's body, kept separate from fog. Fog is frontier: it graduates into issues and gets worked. Deferred is explicitly not: parked so it isn't lost, but never mistaken for a takeable next step by a session scanning the map. Move something to deferred the moment you notice it, from any entry point.

## Entry points

There are two ways to enter this mode: **bootstrap** and **resume**.

### Bootstrap

User invokes with a loose idea.

1. Run a `grill` session with [domain modeling](../design/domain-modeling.md) to surface the open decisions.
2. Create the **map issue** — mostly fog, frontier identified — and open a child issue for each frontier question, resolving trivially-decidable ones inline. Record each issue's gist, link, and blocking edges in the map issue.
3. **Research**-typed children need no user input, unlike the other three types — claim and dispatch a subagent per Research issue now, in parallel, instead of leaving them for a later `Resume` session to pick up one at a time. Bound the fan-out to the Research children just created.
4. Stop resolving anything else here. Map-building is one session's work; the rest of the frontier waits for `Resume`.

### Resume

User invokes with the map issue and an issue.

1. Load the map issue (the index) and **claim** the issue through the tracker so parallel agents don't collide.
2. Resolve it, invoking modes as needed. If in doubt, use `grill` with domain modeling — except a **Grilling**-typed issue: it needs the user live, so if they're not in the session, surface the question on the issue and stop rather than answering on their behalf. Record the answer in the issue body and close it.
3. Update the map issue: replace the issue's fog with its gist plus link, open any newly-discovered child issues with correct blocking edges, and move anything surfaced but out of scope to deferred.
4. Stop.

If the decisions made invalidate other issues, update or close them.

## Parallelism

Issues run in parallel — **claim** an issue before working it, and expect other agents to be resolving siblings. Prefer the tracker's native assignee as the claim: an open, unassigned issue is unclaimed. Native blocking edges keep an issue from being picked up before its blockers close — native matters because the tracker's own UI then renders the frontier visually, takeable at a glance without opening the map; fall back to a body convention only when the tracker has none.

The tracker has no atomic claim, so claiming, resolving, and editing the map are each a read-then-write with a race window in between. Under concurrent sessions:

- **Re-verify before resolving.** Re-fetch the issue right before you record the answer and close it; if it's already closed or carries a claim or answer that isn't yours, stop and reconcile instead of resolving it twice.
- **Re-read the map before editing it.** Its body is rewritten whole, so a stale copy clobbers a sibling's just-added gist — re-fetch immediately before editing, change only your own lines, and re-read after to confirm nothing else vanished.
- **One claim per session.** A resume session resolves only the issue it was invoked with; once that's done the session is spent. Bookkeeping on it is fine, but taking another frontier issue needs a fresh `wayfinder` invocation — a follow-up in the same session otherwise reads as "take the next frontier issue."

## Skipping The Decision Map

Many times, the initial grilling will result in no fog of war. No unresolved issues. Nothing to do, except implement.

In those situations, you should offer the user the chance to skip the decision map - since the decision map is only needed if multi-session decisions need to be made.

If they skip it, you should recommend either implementing directly or the SPEC workflow (PRD → issues) for multi-session work. Running as SPEC's opening phase, record the skip as the phase's `pipeline:` row (`skipped: no fog`) and continue the pipeline.
